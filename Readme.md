Provides current temperature (actual and "how does it feel") 
by the address. If no address is specified, dummy default value is used.

Based on [this online course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/overvie) by **Andrew Mead** and **Rob Percival**.

To start: print `node app.js` to the console.
To try first version: print `node playground.js` to the console. In this version, address argument is required.
To provide address add `--address` or `-a` with a proper value.
To get some help, use `-h` flag.
